# KeyScape

Keyscape is a game made using WebGL and BabylonJS for the "Interactive Graphics" exam 
(Professor: Marco Schaerf) of the academic year 2017/2018.

The main character has been trapped in this place, structured like a maze,
by a criminal organization of scientists that is making an experiment on the survival of the human race.
The magic key is a gate to the real world and it is the only way to escape from this maze. 
Indeed, when you find the key, you win the game. 
This objective is not so easy to reach, cause in the hole land there are little rabbits which are actually robot bombs
that explode if you get too close to them. 
Because of that, the main character has to pass carefully near those rabbits because if they explode the game will be over.
